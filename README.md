# MyFileClass-Java
A class I made many years ago when I was learning Java and the Generic Types.

This class let you store and upload Java objects to a binary file(you can rename the file from <em>.dat</em> to what you prefer).

It is far from complete and it's really simple. You are welcome to add more features to it
